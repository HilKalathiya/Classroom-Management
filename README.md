# Classroom Management Project

## Overview

This project is designed to help manage classroom activities and resources using a web application built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: The programming language for the application.
- **HTML**: For building the frontend interface.
- **Express**: A web application framework for Node.js.
- **Mongoose**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing data.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) installed or use [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) for a cloud solution.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/classroom-management.git
cd classroom-management
```
### Step 2: Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install Express and Mongoose:
```bash
npm install express mongoose
```

### Step 3: Setup MongoDB
If you're using a local MongoDB instance, make sure itâ€™s running. If you're using MongoDB Atlas, create a cluster and obtain your connection string.

### Step 4: Create a .env File
Create a .env file in the root directory of your project to store your environment variables:
```bash
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
```
### Step 5: Run the Application
Use the following command to start the application:
```bash
node index.js
```

Replace index.js with the entry point of your application if it's named differently.

### Step 6: Access the Application
Open your browser and go to http://localhos:8000 (or the port your application is set to run on).
